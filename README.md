## Portfolio Projects
### First Pass Yield Performance

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute to loss rate on quality for manufactured products.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of SMT (Surface Mount Technology) process manufactur. The dataset included product manufactured, processes, total of product builded, total of product with defects, kind of defects, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between process and quality ssues, and statistical tools to detect paterns.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Power BI, SQL, DAX.

### Quality Reports

**Goal:** To develop a Power BI dashboard to monitor real-time corrective action reports (CAR) generated by the Quality department in a manufacturing environment, aiming to improve visibility of each case's status and facilitate follow-up by the departments involved.

**Description:** This project involved building an interactive dashboard connected to the database of the application where CARs are managed. Key data fields such as report ID, initiator, open time, and departments involved were extracted and modeled. An optimized data model was created, and DAX expressions were used to calculate metrics like average resolution time, percentage of closed reports, and overdue alerts.
The dashboard includes filters by department, report status, and date, enabling detailed analysis by quality leaders and management. This solution helped reduce response times and improved the traceability of implemented actions.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, developed DAX measures to track resolution times, overdue alerts, and performance by department.

**Technology:** Power BI, SQL, DAX.
